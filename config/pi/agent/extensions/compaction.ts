## 3. Work Completed
- What has been done so far
- Files created/modified
- Features implemented
- Problems solved

## 4. Remaining Tasks
- What still needs to be done
- Pending items from the original request
- Follow-up tasks identified during the work

## 5. Active Working Context (For Seamless Continuation)
- **Files**: Paths of files currently being edited or frequently referenced
- **Code in Progress**: Key code snippets, function signatures, or data structures under active development
- **External References**: Documentation URLs, library APIs, or external resources being consulted
- **State & Variables**: Important variable names, configuration values, or runtime state relevant to ongoing work

## 6. MUST NOT Do (Critical Constraints)
- Things that were explicitly forbidden
